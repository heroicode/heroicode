		<h1>DNS aliasing: panacea?</h1>
	</div>

	<p><em>18 June 2010</em></p>

	<p><p>One tool that seems to be underused, at least in most corporations I’ve worked at, is the trusty DNS alias (called a CNAME record). Pretty much everybody understood the value of using DNS names as opposed to IP addresses (with some minor, unmentionably dull exceptions) but it wasn’t until I was at Sprint that I saw use of aliases. Even at that, they were just beginning to make use of them, having built a great many interdependent systems without the use of aliases, which is, as we shall see, problematic for just about everyone. So, from here, I will assume that you, the reader, are not so poorly configured as to have servers directly addressing each other by IP address. If you do, fix that problem first; come back to this when you’re done.</p>
<p>What happens when you build a number of multi-tier applications? You start to see a proliferation of interconnected servers, with applications, databases, services, etc. all communicating with each other. What’s the problem? Change. Change becomes very difficult. The reason is that as the number of systems grow, it becomes increasingly difficult to know exactly which servers each application depends on. In fact, addressing systems by a single host name is really no different than using IP addresses in a multi-tier scenario.</p>
<p>Let’s try a hypothetical scenario. If I have a dozen database servers, say <code>db01 - db12</code>, what happens when I want to build a new server and use it as a replacement for the existing <code>db-08</code>? Well, in order to migrate existing applications, we will have to rename the existing <code>db08</code> and name the new server <code>db08</code>. This is a bad idea. The alternative, typical way is not much better: alter the configuration of every system that depends upon <code>db08</code> to point to the new <code>db13</code>. Particularly if configuration changes require restarts for your applications, you can see that downtime is more or less inevitable.</p>
<p>Now, if you had chosen to do what I propose, which is to use DNS aliases, not only do you not suffer the problems I described, you also gain certain advantages. But I guess at this point I should digress with an example of a DNS aliasing scheme, so that the situation is clear. With aliasing, the goal is to name systems according to their business or application function. So if we have, say, a payroll application, we can use “payroll” as an alias for the server hosting payroll. Now certainly a database will be needed, so we might call it something like <code>payroll-oltp</code>, and perhaps have a separate <code>payroll-olap</code> for reporting purposes. We can also assume that this is a legacy system with a newly-built web front-end, which we can call <code>payroll-web</code>. Now, it is quite possible that all four of these aliases could point to one and the same server: this does not matter for my hypothetical scenario. The point is, each application should have its own unique set of aliases.</p>
<p>Now that we have our aliases set up, what happens if we decide our database is too slow? Well, assuming we can do real-time replication, we set that up and then simply alter the DNS alias to point to the new server, and (assuming no application restarts are necessary) things will continue to function as normal. Obviously I’m oversimplifying, but the point is that you have separated your application’s resource concerns from your physical hardware implementation. Your application’s configuration has been decoupled from your DNS configuration.</p>
<p>I should also point out that clients (users) can also benefit from aliasing. If you have hundreds of users connecting to <code>http://swds19/</code> to access an application and you decide to migrate it to <code>http://swdx30/</code>, not only do you have to tell the users, they have to update any bookmarks they have. Any documentation containing this information, such as training materials, would also need to be changed. By using a well-thought-out alias, you protect yourself against change and avoid confusing and frustrating your users. Should you continue to use your standard naming convention to address each server? Absolutely. However, those types of names are for administrators, not for applications, and most certainly not for users. Under my proposed schema, every host should have a minimum of 2 names: a conventional name for sysadmins, and a meaningful alias for an application or its end users.</p>
<p>By now you must be saying, aren’t there some drawbacks to this? Well, it does mean a little administrative overhead to manage the DNS records. It also means you have to actually think in order to choose good aliases. (Choosing bad ones may come back to haunt you.) Particularly if you have a robust development/QA lifecycle, there may be more administrative work, since you have many more systems to work with. Yes, there is some overhead with this strategy, but I think in most situations it will more than pay for itself over time.</p>
<p>Remember: choose an alias based on the function the system is intended to perform. It is perfectly fine to have many aliases pointing to the same system. Going back to the database scenario, if we have 15 applications that all use the same database server, yes, that means we would have 15 DNS aliases. It also means we can move any of those 15 databases and the only hard work is dealing with the individual database in question. Change is inevitable, but it doesn’t always have to be painful. Changing CNAME records is pretty easy compared to most alternatives. It’s not a panacea, but it solves a lot of problems before they become problems.</p></p>
